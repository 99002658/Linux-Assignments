Display the inode numbers of these three files, does the hard links have the same inode? 
Answer: genesis58@Trainee:~/Desktop$ ls -li winter.txt summer.txt hlwinter.txt

ls --color=auto -li winter.txt summer.txt hlwinter.txt 7106609 -rw-rw-r-- 2 genesis58 genesis58 5 Sep 30 17:58 hlwinter.txt 7106618 -rw-rw-r-- 1 genesis58 genesis58 4 Sep 30 17:58 summer.txt 7106609 -rw-rw-r-- 2 genesis58 genesis58 5 Sep 30 17:58 winter.txt
Use the find command to list the two hardlinked files 
Answer: genesis58@Trainee:~/Desktop$ find . -inum 7106609

find . -inum 7106609 ./winter.txt ./hlwinter.txt genesis58@Trainee:~/Desktop$ find . -inum 7106618
find . -inum 7106618 ./summer.txt
Everything about a file is in the inode, except two things : name them! 
Answer: The name of the file is in a directory, and the contents is somewhere on the disk.

Find all files with inode number 2. What does this information tell you ? 
Answer: It tells you there is more than one inode table (one for every formatted partition + virtual file systems)

Look at the directories /etc/init.d/ /etc/rc2.d/ /etc/rc3.d/ ... do you see the links ? 
Answer: ls -l /etc/init.d ls -l /etc/rc2.d ls -l /etc/rc3.d

Look in /lib with ls -l... 
Answer: ls -l /lib

Use find to look in your home directory for regular files that do not(!) have one hard link. 
Answer: genesis58@Trainee:~$ find ~ ! -links 1 -type f

find /home/genesis58 '!' -links 1 -type f /home/genesis58/Desktop/winter.txt /home/genesis58/Desktop/hlwinter.txt
